Code generators for immutable structured data, including algebraic data types, and functions to destructure them.
Structured Data provides three public modules: ``structured_data.adt``, ``structured_data.match``, and ``structured_data.data``.

The ``adt`` module provides a class decorator and annotation type for converting a class into an algebraic data type.

The ``match`` module provides a ``Pattern`` class that can be used to build match structures, and a ``Matchable`` class that wraps a value, and attempts to apply match structures to it.
If the match succeeds, the bindings can be extracted and used.
It includes some special support for ``adt`` subclasses.

The match architecture allows you tell pull values out of a nested structure:

.. code-block:: python3

    structure = (match.pat.a, match.pat.b[match.pat.c, match.pat.d], 5)
    my_value = (('abc', 'xyz'), ('def', 'ghi'), 5)
    matchable = match.Matchable(my_value)
    if matchable(structure):
        # The format of the matches is not final.
        print(matchable['a'])  # ('abc', 'xyz')
        print(matchable['b'])  # ('def', 'ghi')
        print(matchable['c'])  # 'def'
        print(matchable['d'])  # 'ghi'

The ``@`` operator allows binding both the outside and the inside of a structure.
Indexing is forwarded to a ``matches`` attribute, which is ``None`` if the last match was not successful, and otherwise contains an instance of a custom mapping type, which allows building the matched values back up into simple structures.

The ``adt`` decorator exists to create classes that do not necessarily have a single fixed format, but do have a fixed set of possible formats.
This lowers the maintenance burden of writing functions that operate on values of an ``adt`` class, because the full list of cases to handle is directly in the class definition.

Here are implementations of common algebraic data types in other languages:

.. code-block:: python3

    @adt.adt
    class Maybe(typing.Generic[T]):

        Just: adt.Ctor[T]
        Nothing: adt.Ctor

    @adt.adt
    class Either(typing.Generic[E, R]):

        Left: adt.Ctor[E]
        Right: adt.Ctor[R]

The ``data`` module provides classes based on these examples.

Should I Use This?
==================

Until there's a major version out, probably not.

There are several alternatives in the standard library that may be better suited to particular use-cases:

- The ``namedtuple`` factory creates tuple classes with a single structure; the ``typing.NamedTuple`` class offers the ability to include type information. The interface is slightly awkward, and the values expose their tuple-nature easily. (NOTE: In Python 3.8, the fast access to namedtuple members means that they bypass user-defined ``__getitem__`` methods, thereby allowing factory consumers to customize indexing without breaking attribute access. It looks like it does still rely on iteration behavior for various convenience methods.)
- The ``enum`` module provides base classes to create finite enumerations. Unlike NamedTuple, the ability to convert values into an underlying type must be opted into in the class definition.
- The ``dataclasses`` module provides a class decorator that converts a class into one with a single structure, similar to a namedtuple, but with more customization: instances are mutable by default, and it's possible to generate implementations of common protocols.
- The Structured Data ``adt`` decorator is inspired by the design of ``dataclasses``. (A previous attempt used metaclasses inspired by the ``enum`` module, and was a nightmare.) Unlike ``enum``, it doesn't require all instances to be defined up front; instead each class defines constructors using a sequence of types, which ultimately determines the number of arguments the constructor takes. Unlike ``namedtuple`` and ``dataclasses``, it allows instances to have multiple shapes with their own type signatures. Unlike using regular classes, the set of shapes is specified up front.
- If you want multiple shapes, and don't want to specify them ahead of time, your best bet is probably a normal tree of classes, where the leaf classes are ``dataclasses``.
